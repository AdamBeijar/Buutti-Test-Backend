To start the file you first need to create a virtual environment with: <br/>
``` python -m venv ./venv ```

Then you need to activate the virtual environment:<br/>
On Linux/MacOS it is: ```source venv/bin/activate```<br/>
And on windows it is: ```venv\Scripts\activate```<br/>

After that you should run the command: <br/>
``` pip install -r requirements ```

After downloading the required libraries do the following commands: <br/>
``` 
cd buuttiTask
python manage.py runserver localhost:9000
```
